# CSS: The Ultimate Answer to Life, the Universe, and Styling

So you've stumbled upon this folder, which contains the answer to making your website look presentable rather than like something the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal would design. Congratulations on your discovery, though it's considerably less impressive than finding the Ultimate Question.

## What's All This Then?

This directory contains Cascading Style Sheets, a peculiar Earth technology created to make rectangular things look less rectangular, or occasionally more rectangular but with rounded corners, which for some reason is considered vastly superior.

The `styles.css` file is your towel in this vast digital cosmos - vitally important and surprisingly useful. It contains a set of rules that transform the ugly, unstyled HTML into something that won't immediately cause visitors to your site to assume they've made a terrible mistake.

## Colors and Variables

We've defined a set of color variables that are almost, but not quite, entirely unlike random. They've been carefully selected after consulting various digital color wheels, design blogs, and a small potted plant that seemed to have strong opinions on the matter.

The primary color is a shade of blue reminiscent of the sky on Earth (for reference, in case you've forgotten what that looks like). The secondary color is green, which humans seem to associate with success, money, and vegetables - three concepts with surprisingly little overlap.

## A Note on Usage

CSS, like time, is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so. What appears to be a simple set of styling rules is actually a complex network of inheritance, specificity, and browser inconsistencies that would make even the philosophers of Cruxwan University scratch their heads in bewilderment.

Use these styles as a starting point, but remember that true enlightenment comes from understanding that no matter how perfectly you style your website, someone will be viewing it on a device that renders everything as if through a glass of Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster.

Share and Enjoy!
