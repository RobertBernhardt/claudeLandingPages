# The Hitchhiker's Guide to Styles

*"Space," it says, "is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is."* Similarly, the world of web styling is expansive, confusing, and filled with elements that don't behave as expected for no adequately explored reason.

## Welcome to the Styles Directory

This directory serves as a sort of halfway house for various styling-related files, much like the Restaurant at the End of the Universe serves as a convenient location for time travelers to meet without having to synchronize their watches, which would be impossible anyway.

## What's Inside

Inside, you'll find the CSS directory, which contains actual styling information. Why not put the CSS files directly in this directory? For much the same reason that dolphins thank fish for all the fish - it seemed like a good idea at the time, and questioning it now would only lead to existential uncertainty.

This directory structure follows a long tradition of making simple things needlessly complicated, a practice beloved by web developers, government bureaucrats, and the creators of those plastic packages that require scissors to open, which themselves come in packages requiring scissors.

## How to Navigate

To find what you're looking for, you might consider:

1. Looking in the CSS directory, where things actually are
2. Consulting the Improbability Drive
3. Asking a passing whale or bowl of petunias

If all else fails, remember that in an infinite universe, the probability of finding the right CSS file approaches zero, but is never quite zero, which means you've got a chance.

Remember your towel, and don't panic when media queries start contradicting each other. It's just the universe's way of keeping things interesting.
