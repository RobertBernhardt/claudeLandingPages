# The Mostly Harmless Guide to These Scripts

In the beginning, the Scripts were created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.

But fear not, weary traveler of the digital cosmos! These JavaScript files are actually quite friendly once you get to know them. They've been programmed to help your landing page evolve beyond a static lump of HTML into something that would impress even the Magrathean planet builders.

## What Lives Here

This directory contains an improbable collection of JavaScript modules, each serving a specific function with an efficiency that would make the Vogons' bureaucratic hearts flutter (if they had hearts, which is debatable).

The `main.js` file acts as a sort of electronic thumb, hitchhiking its way through the DOM, picking up all the other modules and bringing them along for the ride. The modules themselves perform various tricks that might seem like magic to primitive life forms - making menus appear and disappear, smoothly scrolling to sections without any tea being spilled, and generally creating the illusion that someone competent built this website.

## How to Use

Don't Panic. The scripts have been carefully designed to run with minimal fuss. Unlike the Infinite Improbability Drive, you don't need to prepare a nice hot cup of tea to get them working.

If you must modify these scripts, please remember that coding, like flying, is the art of throwing yourself at the ground and missing. Success often comes when you least expect it, typically after the 42nd attempt.

Further documentation exists in each file, written in a language suspiciously similar to English, though occasionally with technical terms that might as well be Betelgeusian for all the sense they make to newcomers.

Share and Enjoy!
